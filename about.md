Hey there, I'm Samriddha! I'm interested in Networks and Network Security. I'm also experienced in Web Development.

### Education

I am in my final year of studying Computer Science at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (graduating in 2024).  
  
I have been to City International School, Wanowrie, Pune (2020) and The Bishop's Co-Ed School, Undri, Pune (2018).

### Experience

I was a Summer Intern (2023) at Tata Steel OneIT Division, Jamshedpur. I developed Salesforce apps and pages to streamline personnel management of Tata Pravesh. My solution made it simpler for admin users to allot personnel across geographies.

I was a Summer Intern (2022) at Regional Remote Sensing Centre - West, Jodhpur; it is a subsidiary of ISRO. I helped develop WebSocket solutions for presenting VR images and rich presentations without the need for video transmission. This reduced bandwidth consumption and lag, while improving the quality of the presentations.

### Teaching Assistantship

I am a TA of Introduction to Programming offered by Coursera in collaboration with BITS Pilani. I am responsible for improving reading assets, quiz setting and evaluation of midterm and endterm answer scripts.

I was a TA of Computer Programming (Fall '22-'23) and Data Structures and Algorithms (Spring '22-'23) of BITS Pilani. I ensured smooth conduction of lab sessions and created videos explaining the solutions to the lab sheets.

### Academic Projects

I am currently undertaking a project under Dr Vishal Gupta of CSIS Department, BITS Pilani. It aims to develop solutions to implement Deep Packet Inspection in a cloud environment.

I was a part of a project with Dr K Haribabu of CSIS Department, BITS Pilani. The project was to investigate the state of forensic analysis of Software Defined Networks. I studied the state-of-the-art of this emerging field, while proposing Data Mining as a possible solution to generate attack graphs in Forensic SDN analysis.

### Co-Curriculars

I was a part of Nirmaan BITS Pilani chapter. I held the position of Joint Coordinator of Joy of Giving Week - a week-long celebration of the people of Pilani.

### Hobbies

I enjoy reading mystery and fantasy novels. I am also a huge Formula 1 and Ferrari fan.
