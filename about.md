Hey there, I'm Samriddha! I'm interested in Networks and Network Security. I'm also experienced in Web Development.

### Education

I am in my pre-final year of studying Computer Science at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (graduating in 2024).  
  
I have been to City International School, Wanowrie, Pune (2020) and The Bishop's Co-Ed School, Undri, Pune (2018).

### Experience

I was a Summer Intern at Regional Remote Sensing Centre - West, Jodhpur; it is a subsidiary of ISRO. I helped develop WebSocket solutions for presenting VR images and rich presentations without the need for video transmission. This reduced bandwidth consumption and lag, while improving the quality of the presentations.

### Academic Projects

I was a part of a project with Dr K Haribabu of CSIS Department, BITS Pilani. The project was to investigate the state of forensic analysis of Software Defined Networks. I studied the state-of-the-art of this emerging field, while proposing Data Mining as a possible solution to generate attack graphs in Forensic SDN analysis.

### Co-Curriculars

I am a part of Nirmaan's Public Relations Department, where I help maintain their [website](https://bitspilani.nirmaan.org). I have been a member of the dev team at Google Developers Student Club, BITS Pilani.

### Hobbies

I enjoy reading mystery novels. I am also a huge Formula 1 and Ferrari fan.
